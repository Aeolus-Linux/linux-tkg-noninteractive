# linux-tkg-noninteractive

This is a repository for my automatic builds of the linux-tkg kernel. This has a few tweaks for my use case and to reduce the size of the packages, such as nv-optix being removed. Don't use this if you don't want the very latest kernel, or if you want stability. The actual package repository where this is hosted is at https://github.com/Osmium-Linux/Osmium-pkgs
