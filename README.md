This is a repository for my automatic builds of the [linux-tkg kernel.])(https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg) Don't use this if you don't want the very latest kernel, or if you want stability. The actual package repository where this is hosted is at https://github.com/Osmium-Linux/Osmium-pkgs
